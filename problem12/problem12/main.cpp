/*
 The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. 
 So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
 The first ten terms would be:
 
 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
 
 Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
 
  1: 1
  3: 1,3
  6: 1,2,3,6
 10: 1,2,5,10
 15: 1,3,5,15
 21: 1,3,7,21
 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
 We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
 
 What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
