 You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
 
 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
 Thirty days has September,
 April, June and November.
 All the rest have thirty-one,
 Saving February alone,
 Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, 
 but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
 How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century 
 (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
